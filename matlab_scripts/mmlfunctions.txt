Functions I have written for the mml at the ALS

levon_kick.m
	-kicks the particle every third turn using the first corrector magnet.
	
levon_simTunes & levon_simTunesRange
	-measures the tune frequencies from simulated beam data
	
levon_beam_osc_sim
	- simulates an animation of the x position of the beam during cavity failure
	
levon_dumpsimtest
	- simulates changing values of the BPMs given a initial x&y position.
	
levon_bpmTunes & levon_bpmTunes2
	- try to measure the tune frequencies using BPM data and fast fourier transforms (fft) method
